🤖 RoboPlayground – Build, Simulate, and Control Robots in Your Browser
RoboPlayground is a web-based robotics sandbox that lets you upload custom URDF robots, simulate them in a 3D environment, and control them in real time directly from Visual Studio Code.

Whether you're experimenting with motion, testing SLAM logic, or building full robot behaviors, RoboPlayground gives you an interactive, code-driven playground to explore robotics — no installs, no setup, just pure dev flow.

🔑 Core Features:
🧱 URDF Upload & Visualization – Build and import your own robots

🌐 3D Simulation – Interactive environments powered by Three.js and physics engines

🧠 VS Code Integration – Write and run control code straight from your editor

📡 Live Command API – WebSocket interface for real-time robot control

🔄 Extensible – Add your own logic, sensors, SLAM, and more
